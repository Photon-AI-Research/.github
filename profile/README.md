## Welcome to AI for Future Photon Science 👋

🙋‍♀️ We contribute to the understanding of **fundamental properties in photon science** like what happens once a Laser interacts with matter by machine learning. 
From an experiental point of view, we employ very brilliant beams of Photons (X-rays) to image very small-scale or ultra-fast processes. The corresponding problems in computational imaging are approached by ML, too 😀 

🚀 Our ML research is converging into a **digital twin of Laser-driven particle accelerators** which comprises of surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification / outlier detection and [neural solvers](https://github.com/Photon-AI-Research/NeuralSolvers)

🚀 We are also solving **Inverse X-ray imaging problems** by generative models like [normalising flows](https://github.com/Photon-AI-Research/NF4IP) for fast understanding of experimental data from instruments like [HIBEF](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=50566&pNid=694) situated at large-scale facilities  [EuropeanXFEL](https://www.xfel.eu), [DESY](https://www.desy.de), etc.

🌈 Feel free to message [Nico](mailto:n.hoffmann@hzdr.de) if you are interested in contributing to our research 😀
